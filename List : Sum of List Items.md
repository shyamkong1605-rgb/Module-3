# List Operations in Python: Sum of List Items

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **sum of all elements** in a list.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Define a list of numbers.
2. Use Python’s built-in `sum()` function to calculate the total.
3. Print the result.

## 🧾 Program
lst = eval(input())   # To get list of elements from user
sum = sum(lst)        # To sum the list of elements
print(sum)            # To print sum

## Output
